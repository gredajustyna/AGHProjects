## 1. PotraFISZ
Android app made for learning foreign languages by creating flashcards with words. User can create there their own flashcards and categorize them. Only European languages are available to choose, however user can add one of their own. It is my first ever project made for Android and using Android Studio. It was created with my project partner, the UI including the graphics was designed or drawn by me.
